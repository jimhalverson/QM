> "*Quantum mechanics is the description of the behavior of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. Things on a very small scale behave like nothing that you have any direct experience about. They do not behave like waves, they do not behave like particles, they do not behave like clouds, or billiard balls, or weights on springs, or like anything that you have ever seen.*" - [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman).

## Course Information

**Course Schedule:** MR 11:45-1:25

**Course Location:** Forsyth 202

**Description:**  Lays out the basic axioms of quantum mechanics, and the complementarity between the wave function and matrix mechanics approach to quantum systems. Considers systems of spins in static and dynamical settings, deriving the algebra for addition of angular momenta. Introduces the notion of time evolution and coherent states/wave packets. Demonstrates the solution to numerous one and three-dimensional problems, including the harmonic oscillator and hydrogren
atom. Extends these results to new settings via the use of perturbation theory. Some advanced topics will be covered, 
such as the path
integral and GHZ systems.

**Course Goals:**

- Understand the relation between physical observables and quantum operators.
- To appreciate the need for complex quantum states, and how phases are related to physically meaningful quantities.
- To develop familiarity in solving physical eigenvalue problems.
- To be able to understand the time evolution of dynamical systems.
- To become familiar with the use of raising and lowering operators in various systems.
- To learn basic techniques in the solving of differential equations relevant to quantum systems in one and three dimensions.
- To become adept at the use of approximation methods such as perturbation theory.
- To expose students to topical advanced subjects such as groups and symmetries, entanglement, decoherence and quantum information theory.

**Resources:** The textbook we will use is *A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics (2nd ed.)*
by John S. Townsend. Not all material covered in lectures will be found in the textbook, so attendance at lectures is strongly encouraged. It is assumed that you will have read the relevant textbook passages before attending the lectures.


I will also try to regularly post lecture notes *before* lecture. They won't be perfect, but small errors not caught beforehand
will hopefully be caught during class, and I will update accordingly. See discussion below about why I'm posting notes.

**Office Hours:** Three hours per week are set aside for office hours, when I will meet with students outside of class.
Office hours are primarily for discussion of homework problems or course concepts, though questions about broader
areas of physics are welcomed if no one present is looking to discuss course material. Please, come, office hours
are fun and students often find them helpful!

**Homework:** Problem sets will be assigned each week. They
 will be collected at the start of the lecture on the day they
 are due. New assignments will
 be posted to the homework folder. Late assignments will not be collected 
 under any
 circumstance. Instead, your lowest homework score will be dropped; if
 it is a missed assignment it is your responsibility to learn the
 material, since it may appear on the midterm or final exam. You may
 discuss the assignments with your classmates, but the work you submit
 must be your own. Homework questions will not be answered via e-mail; please
 come to office hours. Questions regarding homework grading should be directed
 to both graders via e-mail.

**Midterm:** There will be an in-class midterm on February 14 that may test any of the material from homework or class up to that date.

**Final Exam:** There will be a take home final exam, distributed
  during the last class. All final exams must be
 returned to my office, Dana 226, by 9AM on the last day of finals. If I am not
 in my office, you may put it under my closed door, but you ***must*** send
 me an e-mail alerting me and telling me the time of delivery. The
 exam is *your work only*.

**Grading:** Your final grade will be determined based on your
 performance on the homework assignments and the final
 exam. The scoring breakdown is as follows: homework 50%,
 final 30%, midterm 20%.

**Final Letter Grade:**
Your course grade will be determined both by your overall weighted total score, with the weights given above under “Grading”. The following table indicates ‘target’ overall score ranges corresponding to various final course grades

- A = 93-100%
- A- = 88-92%
- B+ = 84-88%
- B = 78-84%
- B- = 74-78%
- C+ = 70-74%
- C = 65-70%
- C- = 60-65%

Since exams and assignments can vary slightly in difficulty from semester to semester, the actual score ranges may be adjusted slightly downward from those given in the table. That is, if your final percentage falls in one of the above ranges, you will receive the associated letter grade or higher. Under extreme circumstances the ranges may be shifted in the opposite direction, but this will be announced explicitly in class before Mar 20.

## Comments and Recommendations

**Lessons from Previous Semesters:**
Happily, this is my third time teaching this beautiful subject, and based on previous student experience there are some things
that you should know at the outset:
- **Why post lecture notes?** I cannot emphasize this enough: this course moves quickly. As your professor,
I owe it to you to prepare you as much as possible for next stages, which means learning a lot of material; I'll
explain this in more depth in class. We'll be able to cover a lot of material by stressing a deep understanding
of concepts, which will be buttressed by concrete calculations in class, as well as on homeworks and exams.
**However**, this means that information will be coming quickly on the board, and in previous semesters a few students
have found it difficult to think about the concepts while also hearing the content of my words and copying
down equations. To that end, I want to make your life easier: generally, I will attempt to post lecture
notes before class. See description and caveats above.
- **Eigenvectors and eigenvalues:** they are a major part of the course, and I will review them and all of the other
aspects of linear algebra below, but I will not teach you how to actually compute them (just as I will not
teach you matrix multiplication), since that's what a linear algebra course is for. **Be sure** you know how
to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for 2x2 and 3x3 matrices, because you might need to know it on the midterm,
and I will often ask for an interpretation of the result of an eigenvalue or eigenvector calculation --- it is 
impossible to get the right interpretation without the calculation being done correctly. **On homework or the
take-home final**, feel free to compute the eigenvectors or eigenvalues using your favorite software package (such
as Wolfram Alpha) and print the result, because in this course we care about the *physics* of the eigenvectors, not precisely how
they are computed (for which there are many algorithms).

**Linear Algebra Background:**
Quantum mechanics relies heavily on linear algebra. While some of the basics will be covered in the course, I strongly encourage you to review the following concepts:
- Vectors and vector spaces.
- Matrices / linear maps. ("operators" in QM language).
- Inner product / norm.
- Bases.
- Basis change.
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

**Study Groups:**
You are strongly encouraged to form small groups to work together on the homework. This will aid in the learning process, but note that it is very important that you participate in finding the solutions, and you present your own write-up. Doing so is critical for learning the material and doing well on the final, since the latter must be entirely your own work.

**Help:**
If you have trouble with the homework, seek help immediately; do not fall behind in the course. You have several places to go for help: your lecturer (after class or during office hours); the Physics Workshop in 300 Churchill near the physics labs (a schedule should be posted near 111 Dana by the second week of class). There is also peer tutoring available.

**Academic Integrity and Misconduct:**
Be sure to review Northeastern Academic Integrity policies, which are [here](http://www.northeastern.edu/osccr/academic-integrity-policy/).

Appropriate disciplinary action, potentially including failing the student, will be taken in the event of cheating, plagiarism, dishonesty, or other academic misconduct. Since students in this course are often encouraged to work in teams, some specific remarks are in order. It is not considered cheating if you:

- Work together on homework assignments, as long as you each work out and submit your own final answers.
- Get help from professors, physics workshop, tutors, etc. on the homework assignments.
- Work together on preparing for exams. 

It is considered cheating if you:
- Submit work done by others (without your participation) as your own.
- Copy work on exams.

**In addition, please review the relevant College of Science Academic Course Policies**
